This folder contains several jupyter notebooks that walk users through the details of how to fit different models with the glmhmm package. Most of these examples use simulated data for illustration purposes. However, the <code>fit-real-data.ipynb</code> notebook offers a more specific tutorial on how to fit the model to the data sets described in [Bolkan, Stone et al 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.23.453573v1). You can find this data in the <code>glmhmm/data</code> folder. This notebook also recreates many of the figures panels associated with the modeling results from that paper.
