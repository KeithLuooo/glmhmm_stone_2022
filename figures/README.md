This folder contains several jupyter notebooks that walk users through the details of how to fit GLMs and GLM-HMMs to the real data described in [Bolkan, Stone et al 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.23.453573v1). These notebooks recreate all the plots associated with the modeling results in the paper and provide a useful starting point for users who might want to run similar analyses on their own data. 

The <code>data</code> folder contains all the relevant data to reproduce the plots in a manner slightly processed from its original form (e.g. reformatted from .mat files into .npy files that are readable as matrices in python). The data in its original form (as well as some additional data collected during the task) is available on figshare [here](https://figshare.com/search?q=10.6084%2Fm9.figshare.17299142). To see other plots from the paper, check out my co-author Scott Bolkan's [github repository](https://github.com/ssbolkan/BolkanStoneEtAl). 

The <code>matlab</code> folder contains a small number of matlab scripts that were used to plot the psychometric curves shown in the paper. There's no need to run any scripts in this folder yourself (unless you want to). Everythiing contained in that folder is run automatically through the jupyter notebooks, using the MATLAB Engine API for Python.
